# Whittell-Wildlife
We employ camera traps to estimate wildlife population dynamics in Whittell Forest. By capturing images of animals over time, we monitor species presence, abundance, and behavior, providing crucial data for conservation efforts and ecosystem management. The method offers a non-invasive, cost-effective way to study and protect local wildlife.
